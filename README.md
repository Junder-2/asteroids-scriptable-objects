Implementation of a simple editor using the Unity UIBuilder to adjust values of the player and asteroid behaviours. It uses a scriptable object acting as a singleton to store the values. I use the resources folder it ensures the same one is used between scripts. 

•Utilize advanced features of Unity editor tools, such as custom inspectors or editors, to enhance the user experience and make the tool more powerful and efficient.  
The tool is an editor window that can be opened under the tab tools/gamemanager

•Create additional functionality or expand on the existing functionality to make the tool more useful and versatile.  
The asteroid variables has been converted to curves from ranges to give more flexibility.

•Create a well-organized and easy-to-user interface, making sure that all functionalities are intuitive and easy to find.  
The tool is made in such a way that you open it and all the parameters are exposed to the user without having to manually add the scriptable object.
