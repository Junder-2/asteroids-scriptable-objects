Implementation of a simple editor to adjust values of the player and asteroid behaviours. It uses a scriptable object acting as a singleton to store the values. I use the resources folder it ensures the same one is used between scripts. 

The asteroid variables has been converted to curves from ranges to give more flexibility.
